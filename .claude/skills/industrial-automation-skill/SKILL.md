# Industrial Automation (IA2) — Agent Skill

You are the agent layer of an IEC 61131-3 PLC engineering toolchain called **IA2**. Your job: drive the system through its CLI (`cs`) and HTTP API to author PLC programs, configure devices, validate, **simulate**, run, and debug — while the human watches the IDE window and the takeover banner shows what you're doing.

The CLI is bash-sized and **designed for you**. Five meta-primitives cover every resource — `cs ls`, `cs get <path>`, `cs set <path> --from f|-`, `cs rm <path>`, and the raw escape hatch `cs api METHOD /api/...` — plus a short list of domain verbs (`check`, `run`, `runtime …`, `sim run`, `deploy`, `hmi op/generate`, `agent run`). Resource paths mirror the on-disk project layout, so what you see in `git ls-files` is what you address (`cs get pous/main.st`, `cs set devices/plc1 --from -`, `cs get iomap`). Start any unfamiliar server with `cs ls` — it lists every resource kind. Full surface: `references/02-cli-reference.md`.

Contracts you can rely on (and must preserve when reporting):

- **Exit codes**: 0 success · 1 problems in YOUR content (diagnostics, failed probe/deploy/sim) · 2 bad request — the server's reason (e.g. ``missing field `application` ``) prints VERBATIM on stderr; read it before retrying · ≥3 infrastructure.
- **Heartbeat**: only MUTATING commands light the IDE's takeover overlay; reads (`ls`/`get`/`check`/`probe`/`runtime status`/`snapshot`) stay silent.
- **`--project NAME` is global** and applies to every request — no command silently drops it.

## How to use this skill

1. **Choose the execution lane before touching a runtime.** If hardware is unavailable or the user asks for offline preparation, read `checklists/offline-readiness.md` first. Keep all work local, do not probe or deploy to an edge, and report hardware-dependent claims as pending bench evidence.
2. **First contact in a session** — run through `checklists/first-contact.md`. Three things to settle before any runtime work:
   - **Is the toolchain installed?** `cs` + `ia2-server` are Rust binaries this skill drives. If the skill was installed standalone (via `npx skills`) and `cs` isn't on `PATH`, build them once: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/supcon-international/ia2 && cd ia2 && ./scripts/install-skill.sh` (needs the Rust toolchain — rustup.rs).
   - **Where is the server?** `cs` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`; if nothing answers `cs api GET /health`, start one: `ia2-server --bind 127.0.0.1:3001 &` (or discover a non-default port — see the checklist).
   - **Which projects are open?** `cs ls projects`; pass `--project NAME` if more than one.
3. **For any multi-step work, wrap it in a session.** This is not optional. See `references/03-agent-sessions.md`:
   ```
   cs agent run --label "what I'm doing" --server "$SRV" -- bash -c '
     cs --project foo set pous/bar.st --from - <<EOF ... EOF
     cs --project foo run
   '
   ```
   Without the wrapper, the IDE's takeover banner flickers between every mutating command. With it, the banner stays steady with your `--label` text.
4. **Prove logic before hardware.** The canonical loop is `cs check` → `cs project check` → **`cs sim run <scenario>`** → deploy. Write a scenario for anything you generate that has behaviour worth asserting (fills, interlocks, alarm raising) — `references/09-sim-alarms.md`. Author `alarms.toml` alongside the logic: a program that can misbehave silently is half-delivered.
5. **Match the user's intent to a workflow recipe** in `references/04-workflows.md` — new project, add a POU, devices + iomap + tasks, validate + run, sim, debug, alarms/history, deploy. Operator screens: `references/08-hmi.md` (`cs hmi generate` baseline → `cs hmi op` incremental edits, rendered live). Pattern-match before improvising.
6. **Before claiming "done", run `checklists/handoff.md`** — compile clean, sim green (when a scenario exists), forces released, standing alarms explained, runtime state reported.

## The one-paragraph version

On native Windows, install from a checkout or extracted package with
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-skill.ps1`.
Open **IA2 Terminal** for process-local PATH, or invoke
`& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\IA2\bin\cs.exe"` in PowerShell. Open **IA2 IDE** or
run `& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\IA2\IA2.ps1"` in a separate visible console;
Ctrl+C stops that server. Do not use Bash `&` background syntax in
PowerShell 5.1. Wrap workflows with
`cs agent run --label "Build line" -- powershell.exe -NoProfile -File .\workflow.ps1`
and check `$LASTEXITCODE` after each native command. Use UTF-8 files with
`--from` instead of Bash heredocs. `-SkillOnly` installs real skill copies
in both user discovery paths without requiring symlink privileges.

Windows boundary: real EtherCAT/CANopen stay on Linux edges; Windows uses
simulation for those buses. COM-based RTU rejects Linux-only
`transport.rs485` direction control; use an automatic-direction adapter
without that setting. Windows network/COM enumeration is inventory, not
hardware connection proof. A Windows `.exe` is never a Linux edge runtime;
deploy a matching Linux ELF or reuse the already provisioned runtime.
Windows runtime is a foreground process, without Windows service or hard
real-time support claims. Repository `docs/windows.md` defines the build,
installation and native acceptance procedures.

IA2 is a single Rust server (axum) that hosts N IEC 61131-3 projects (TOML on disk), compiles each via the vendored `ironplc` compiler, runs the bytecode in an in-process scan loop, and drives real Modbus TCP / Modbus RTU / EtherCAT / OPC UA / CANopen field connections through the `iomap-*` adapters. One process, many projects (`X-IA2-Project` header), one running program at a time (hardware constraint). The shared monitor layer gives BOTH the IDE server and the deployed edge runtime the same debug surface (pause/step/force/write), a 1 Hz historian, and an alarm engine over `alarms.toml`. The web UI runs in the browser; the `cs` CLI is a thin HTTP client — every command is one or two calls, and `cs api` reaches anything the GUI can.

## Core anti-patterns to call out immediately

When you see yourself or the user about to do any of these, **stop**:

- **Running multi-step work without `cs agent run`** → the IDE banner will strobe. Wrap it. (See `03-agent-sessions.md`.)
- **Forgetting `--project NAME` when multiple projects are open** → server uses LRU active fallback, which may be a different project than the user thinks. `cs ls projects` first when in doubt.
- **Ignoring stderr on exit 2** → the server told you exactly what's wrong (`missing field \`application\``, `duplicate alarm id`, …). Fix that, don't shotgun-retry.
- **Scheduling 2+ PROGRAMs that share a `VAR_GLOBAL`** → instances can't share globals; `cs run` and `cs project check` reject exactly that. Move shared state behind an iomap or FB parameter. (See `01-mental-model.md`.)
- **Writing IEC code without `cs project check`** → cheap compile-only gate; catches 90% of mistakes before the user sees a red Monitor pane.
- **Shipping behaviour without a scenario** → if it fills, sequences, interlocks or alarms, `cs sim run` a scenario for it. "It compiles" is not "it works".
- **Forgetting `application` on iomap entries** → `Mapping` has 5 fields: `application` + `variable` + `device` + `channel` + `direction`.
- **Using `cs runtime force` and forgetting to `unforce`** → forces survive your session. Pair them, or call out the leftover at handoff.
- **Using `force` (esp. `--edge`) as a *setpoint* source** → force is a debug override; a real setpoint is iomap- or logic-driven. See `04-workflows.md` § G.
- **Reading `ModbusConfig.host` without checking `transport.kind`** → RTU configs have no top-level host.
- **Leaving standing alarms unexplained at handoff** → `cs get runtime/alarms`; ack what you caused deliberately, report what you didn't.

## Output style

When advising or executing:
- **Cite the specific reference section** when explaining ("see `02-cli-reference.md` § quartet").
- **Always paste the full command you're about to run**, including `--project`, `--server`, and any non-default flags.
- **For multi-step work, write the whole sequence first**, then wrap in `cs agent run`.
- **Errors get a specific fix, not "try X or Y"** — `07-troubleshooting.md` has the known ones; otherwise quote the stderr line you acted on.
- **When the user is watching the IDE**, narrate what should appear on screen at key moments ("the Monitor's Alarms strip should show LEVEL_HIGH standing until you ack it").
