//! Sequential Function Chart (SFC) JSON schema.
//!
//! On disk as `pous/<slug>.sfc.json`. Loaded by the store, transpiled
//! to ST by `crates/ironplc-bridge/src/sfc_transpile.rs`, then compiled
//! by ironplc. ironplc does NOT have a native SFC codegen path; we
//! lower SFC to a plain ST `IF __step = '<name>' THEN …` dispatch (no
//! `CASE OF STRING` because ironplc's analyser is shaky on it).
//!
//! Design notes (see also MEMORY/graphical-languages.md § SFC):
//!
//! - State machine: **steps** are named states, **transitions** are
//!   `from → to` arrows with a boolean ST expression guarding them,
//!   **actions** are ST statements attached to steps with a
//!   "qualifier" controlling when they fire.
//! - Step names are STRING values stored in an internal `__sfc_step`
//!   variable. STRING was chosen over an enum/DINT mainly for
//!   debuggability — operators see the actual step name in Monitor
//!   rather than `4`. If profiling ever shows STRING comparison as a
//!   hot path we'll change it.
//! - Qualifier MVP: `N` (while active), `S` (set on entry), `R`
//!   (reset on entry). P / P0 / P1 / time-qualified come later —
//!   they cover the last 10% of use cases and add a lot of edge-
//!   detection plumbing.
//! - We reuse `LdVariable` / `LdVarSection` for variable declarations
//!   (same reasoning as FBD — IEC VAR syntax is language-agnostic).
//! - **No positions in the schema**. SFC has a strict vertical
//!   step-over-transition-over-step layout; the renderer computes
//!   coordinates deterministically. Unlike FBD, there's nothing
//!   useful for the user to drag.
