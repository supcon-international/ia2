//! Ladder Diagram (LD) JSON schema.
//!
//! An LD POU lives on disk as `pous/<slug>.ld.json` and follows the
//! shape defined here. Loaded by the store, transpiled to ST by the
//! bridge, then compiled by ironplc. The transpilation pass is in
//! `crates/ironplc-bridge/src/ld_transpile.rs`.
//!
//! Design notes (see also MEMORY/graphical-languages.md):
//!
//! - JSON is the *canonical* storage format. No PLCopen XML round-trip.
//! - Each rung carries a recursive `LdNode` boolean expression
//!   (contact / coil / and / or / not). Series = AND, parallel = OR.
//! - Coil kinds: standard (`:=`), set (latch-on), reset (latch-off).
//!   Pulse / edge variants come later.
//! - Variables declared up-front in `variables`. The transpiler emits
//!   VAR / VAR_INPUT / VAR_OUTPUT blocks from that list — keeping the
//!   schema flat (just a section enum per var) instead of grouping by
//!   section in the JSON, which would be more nesting for agents to
//!   produce.
