//! Bridges the ironplc VM scan loop to:
//!  - `tokio::sync::broadcast` for streaming `VarSnapshot`s to subscribers.
//!  - `iocore::IoDevice` adapters for reading inputs before `run_round` and
//!    writing outputs after.
//!
//! The scan thread is a dedicated `std::thread` that hosts a single-thread
//! tokio runtime; everything bus-related runs inside it. ironplc's
//! `VmRunning::run_round` itself is sync.
//!
//! Multi-PROGRAM execution (ADR-0001): the one scan thread hosts N
//! `VmRunning` instances ("units"), one per scheduled PROGRAM instance,
//! each compiled into its own `Container`. Every unit keeps its own
//! cadence anchor from its task's interval; units due on the same tick
//! run in task-priority order (then tasks.toml declaration order).
//! Devices stay owned by the thread and are shared across units
//! sequentially — no concurrency on the bus.
